# MC\_Google\_Visualization #

MC\_Google\_Visualization provides simple support for integrating Google Visualization charts and graphs with your own internal database.  It includes a complete parser for the [Google Visualization Query Language](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/querylanguage.html), giving you the same ease of pivoting and formatting data from your database as is currently possible with Google Spreadsheets.

MC\_Google\_Visualization is written as a PHP 5 class and currently supports the MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL database engines using PDO.  Adding other database engines should be trivial, and patches are always welcome.  We also require either the JSON extension to be installed, or the Zend\_Json class from the Zend Framework available.
